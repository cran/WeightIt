\title{Optimization-Based Weighting}

\description{
This page explains the details of estimating optimization-based weights by setting \code{method = "optweight"} in the call to \code{\link{weightit}} or \code{\link{weightitMSM}}. This method can be used with binary, multinomial, and continuous treatments.

In general, this method relies on estimating weights by solving a quadratic programming problem subject to approximate or exact balance constraints. This method relies on \code{\link[optweight]{optweight}} from the \pkg{optweight} package.

Because \code{optweight} offers finer control and uses the same syntax as \code{weightit}, it is recommended that \code{\link[optweight]{optweight}} be used instead of \code{weightit} with \code{method = "optweight"}.

\subsection{Binary Treatments}{
For binary treatments, this method estimates the weights using \code{\link[optweight]{optweight}}. The following estimands are allowed: ATE, ATT, and ATC. The weights are taken from the output of the \code{optweight} fit object. When \code{include.obj = TRUE}, the returned object is the \code{optweight} fit.
}
\subsection{Multinomial Treatments}{
For multinomial treatments, this method estimates the weights using \code{\link[optweight]{optweight}}. The following estimands are allowed: ATE and ATT. The weights are taken from the output of the \code{optweight} fit object. When \code{include.obj = TRUE}, the returned object is the \code{optweight} fit.
}
\subsection{Continuous Treatments}{
For binary treatments, this method estimates the weights using \code{\link[optweight]{optweight}}. The weights are taken from the output of the \code{optweight} fit object. When \code{include.obj = TRUE}, the returned object is the \code{optweight} fit.
}
\subsection{Longitudinal Treatments}{
For longitudinal treatments, \code{optweight} estimates weights that simultaneously satisfy balance constraints at all time points, so only one model is fit to obtain the weights. Using \code{method = "optweight"} in \code{weightitMSM} cause \code{is.MSM.method} to be set to \code{TRUE} by default. Setting it to \code{FALSE} will run one model for each time point and multiply the weights together, a method that is not recommended.
}
\subsection{Sampling Weights}{
Sampling weights are supported through \code{s.weights} in all scenarios.

\section{Additional Arguments}{
All arguments to \code{optweight} can be passed through \code{weightit} or \code{weightitMSM}, with the following exception:

\code{targets} cannot be used and is ignored.

All arguments take on the defaults of those in \code{optweight}.

}
\note{
The specification of \code{tols} differs between \code{weightit} and \code{optweight}. In \code{weightit}, one tolerance value should be included per level of each factor variable, whereas in \code{optweight}, all levels of a factor are given the same tolerance, and only one value needs to be supplied for a factor variable. Because of the potential for confusion and ambiguity, it is recommended to only supply one value for \code{tols} in \code{weightit} that applies to all variables. For finer control, use \code{optweight} directly.

With point treatments, the returned fit object when \code{include.obj = TRUE} is an \code{optweight} obj, but with longitudinal treatments, the returned object is the output of a call to \code{optweight.fit}.

Seriously, just use \code{\link[optweight]{optweight}}.
